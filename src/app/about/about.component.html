  Hello, my name is Brendan and I'm a Portland, Oregon based web developer. I recently completed the PHP/Drupal track at Epicodus in Portland, Oregon. I joined Epicodus because I love to learn and I enjoy working in groups to solve problems. Every day provides a new set of coding challenges and frustrations and I relish in breaking them down and solving them, bit by bit.
