  Hello, my name is Brendan and I'm a web developer based in Portland, Oregon. I recently completed the PHP/Drupal track at Epicodus, a coding bootcamp based here in Portland. I joined Epicodus because I love to learn and I enjoy working in groups to solve problems. Every day provides a new set of coding challenges and frustrations and I relish in breaking them down and solving them, bit by bit!
